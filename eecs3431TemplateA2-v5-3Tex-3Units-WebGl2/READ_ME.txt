- F.L NAME Partners : Amirreza Touraji & Melika Sherafat 




- STORY LINE : A kung fu guy is reaching out to his sword that has been sealed in a stone for a long time ... and a meteorite is heading his way. Will he be able to reach to it in time to slice the meteorite 
in half or not ????  We shall never know ....... :) 

- The first 8 required elements have been implemented and there are 5 different textures mapped and used in this code with their pictures provided in the file. 

- There is an extra light source effect that is added and provides extra shininess that is above and south of the character.

- An audio has been put on the animation as well.

- At the end we see a fade out happenning due to the impact of the meteorite and everything goes dark. 

- I only used a little bit of my coordinates in the first assignment only for the human gesture ( around 4 or 5 lines of coordinations ). 

- There are different POW's of this event happening as both the human and meteorite get close together and a flying 360 Camera positioning has been done at the beginning of the animation. 

- I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE ANIMATION <3 !!!
